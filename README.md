# Robustness_tutorial
An tutorial in robustness including Bayesian Dropout and Adversarial attacks.

## Models

Creating three models; One simple, one trained with dropout and one trained and predict with dropout ([Dropout as a Bayesian Approximation:
Representing Model Uncertainty in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02142.pdf)) and train those on the MNIST dataset.

## Validation

Test the three models on rotated images and how robust they are against adversarial attacks.

## Framework
Python with tensorflow 2.0.0-beta1
